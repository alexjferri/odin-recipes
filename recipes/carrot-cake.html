    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ooey gooey carrot butter cake hits somewhere between a carrot cake, a chess bar, and a cheesecake. It has crisp sugary edges, a gooey interior, and a soft cookie-like crust which makes the cake extra scrumptious.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>baking spray with flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and divided</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded carrot (about 4 carrots)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 (15.25-ounce) box spice cake mix (such as Duncan Hines)</li>
        <li> large eggs, at room temperature, divided</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>4 cups powdered sugar, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with baking spray; line bottom and sides with parchment paper leaving a 2-inch overhang on long sides.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and just starting to brown slightly, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a heatproof bowl; stir in cardamom. Chill in the refrigerator, uncovered, until completely cool, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While carrots cool, beat cake mix, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and remaining 1/2 cup butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-low speed just until combined, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pat mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides.</li>
        <li>Add powdered sugar, lemon zest, salt, remaining 2 eggs, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla; beat on medium-low speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cooled carrots and pecans until evenly dispersed.</li>
        <li>Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over cake mix layer in pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is lightly golden, shiny, and slightly crackly, about 40 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on a wire rack, about 2 to 3 hours. (Itâ€™s OK if topping sinks slightly as it cools.)</li>
        <li>Using parchment paper as handles, remove from pan and cut into bars. Dust with powdered sugar. Garnish with pecans.</li>

    </ol>
